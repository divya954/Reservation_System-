#Project Title: Wedding Venue Reservation System

##Description:

Welcome to the Wedding Venue Reservation System! A project fueled by my passion for seamless event planning. As part of my bachelor's degree in Information Systems, I've developed a system that simplifies the process of booking wedding venues.

Key Features:

1. Smart Database Design: Our system's core is a carefully crafted database. It stores all the details about venues and bookings, ensuring that users can easily find and manage their reservations.

2. Smooth Backend Handling: Powered by PHP, our system's backend ensures smooth interactions and reliable data management. From login screens to storing information securely, PHP handles it all with finesse.

3. Stylish Frontend Design: Our user interface, built using Bootstrap 4.0, is both elegant and functional. It's designed to be easy to use, with forms and menus that guide users through the booking process effortlessly.

Join us on this journey where technology meets celebration! Together, let's redefine how we book wedding venues.
